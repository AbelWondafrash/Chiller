# Chiller

## What is this? 🤔
This is a program written for running an Industrial Chiller as an Internship program project.

### Chiller? ❄
Industrial chillers are used for controlled cooling of products, mechanisms and factory machinery in a wide range of industries.

### Application
 * Plastic industries,
 * Injection and blow molding,
 * Metal working cutting oils,
 * Welding equipment,
 * Die-casting and machine tooling,
 * chemical processing, etc.
 

### Statement of the Problem
Any utility machinery is vital for any industry's fundametal functionaing. A chiller, as a utility machine in a chemical industry is no exception. Where there would be a quality issue because by temperature difference, a mechanism of keeping temperature at a desired level is critical.

At the place where I interned, cold water from chiller machines is used by numerous machines and products – without which the production of 3 of the factories within the unit would be severely hindered, if at all possible over time.

During my internship at this industry, only one of two chiller machines was functioning properly. As such, the load of this functioning chiller is almost twice as much rendering its' lifespan shorter and shorter with every use. Due to the fact that the machine itself is not a very recent product, spare parts are not only hard to find but practically obsolete. And their equivalent, however unsuited for this machine, costs over 10,000 ETB for the Modbus and about 3,500 – exclusive of VAT, shipping and other costs.


### Significance of the Project
Energy, cost of production, resources, market demand, and time are key things in the production of any item. In the production of soap, it is critical to keep an eye on its temperature. If the temperature is higher or lower than a given range, the soap quality will be severely damaged and the mix will be prone to recycling. Which in turn compromises energy, time, and product quality.

For 3 years now, one of the two chillers had not been working for the major controlling and powering circuitry was stolen. This had put load on the only chiller working. It is also not the case that this one machine can handle the load, it is that there is a compromise in quality as a result of lack of cooling water. This poses a serious threat in that, if this working chiller is to face a serious functional issue, products in lines 1, 2, BrandX, and DMD BrandY Ajax production and their production machineries are rendered useless. The production issue goes all the way to the consumer who at at some time might consider changing brand of soap they used to lest it not meeting previous promised standards.

Considering that, the impact of having to share the load with a secondary machine becomes apparently impactful.
