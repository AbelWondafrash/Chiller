# Chiller

## What is this? ü§î
This is a program written for running an Industrial Chiller as an Internship program project.

### Chiller? ‚ùÑ
Industrial chillers are used for controlled cooling of products, mechanisms and factory machinery in a wide range of industries.

### Application
 * Plastic industries,
 * Injection and blow molding,
 * Metal working cutting oils,
 * Welding equipment,
 * Die-casting and machine tooling,
 * chemical processing, etc.

### Method Employed
* Winsorized Mean - Sophisitcated Averaging

A Winsorized mean is a Winsorized statistical measure of central tendency, much like the mean and median, and even more similar to the truncated mean. It involves the calculation of the mean after winsorizing ‚Äì replacing given parts of a probability distribution or sample at the high and low end with the most extreme remaining values.

This method a useful estimator because it is less sensitive to outliers than the mean but will still give a reasonable estimate of central tendency or mean for almost all statistical models. In this regard it is referred to as a robust estimator.
